# Functionality:
1) Connects all retail stores to manufacturers of the products they sell.

2) Transactions are made through Ethereum blockchain.

3) Manufacturer monitors which products they have produced, 
which product is at which retail store, or in case of individual, who owns what product.

3) Owners are stored by addresses.

4) Manufacturer states whether a product is genuine or fake once a unique name is provided to them. On top of that, they state where it is currently available.

5) Manufacturer observes all transactions, and therefore you cannot do a transaction to a store that dont own the listed item. That means you are protected from scam.
